Data visualization is the graphical representation of data and information using charts, graphs, maps, and other visual elements. Its goal is to make complex data easier to understand, and to communicate insights and patterns that may be difficult to discern from raw data alone.

Data visualization is used in a wide range of fields, including business, science, engineering, healthcare, and social sciences. It is a crucial tool for data analysis, as it enables analysts to identify trends, outliers, and patterns in large datasets.
